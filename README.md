### The item set builder and inspector for League of Legends

[Live Demo](http://lolarmory.net/)

This is my submission for the [Riot API Challenge 2.0](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/2lxEyIcE). The challenge is to develop a piece of software that creates a benefit for players utilizing the recent release of the [Item Set documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/item-sets).

The goal of this project is to help players better understand their item choices by creating a sandbox for experimenting with item sets.

## Player Benefits
* Browse the in-game store out-of-game (you know, since you can't stop thinking about League outside of League)
* Build and save custom item sets
* Browse recommended item sets for each champâ€”these are the same recommended sets you see in-game (great for nubs)
* Try sample builds from your item set and inspect all item stats at once
* Browse item recipes at a glance

## Features
* Search champions
* Drag and drop items from the store into your custom item set
* Edit the name and blocks for your item set
* Generate JSON for the custom item set

## Learned
Things I learned for this project:
* How to deploy to a production server
* How to write Rake tasks and db migrations
* How to design a db schema

## Technologies
* Capistrano/Passenger/Nginx
* Ruby on Rails
* Haml/Sass
* jQuery/Bootstrap
